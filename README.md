This project focuses on predicting product sales using machine learning techniques by analyzing the impact of advertising expenditure across different platforms such as TV, radio, and newspapers. Using a regression-based approach in Python, the dataset is explored and visualized to understand relationships between advertising spend and sales, followed by data splitting into training and testing sets. A Linear Regression model is then trained to learn patterns from historical data and predict future sales, with performance evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R² score. The results help identify which advertising channels contribute most to sales, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions, optimize advertising budgets, and maximize overall sales performance.
